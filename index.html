                        At 14 years old, Tarantino wrote one of his earliest works, a screenplay called Captain Peachfuzz and the Anchovy Bandit, based on Hal Needham's 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit starring Burt Reynolds.

                    <p>

                <p>
                    Death Proof is a 2007 American exploitation slasher film. It stars Kurt Russell as a stuntman who murders young women in staged car accidents using his "death-proof" stunt car. <br>
                    The film pays homage to the slasher, exploitation and muscle car films of the 1970s. <br>
                    Death Proof uses various unconventional techniques to make the film appear more like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout the feature, the film was intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape.
